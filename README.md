# ClipLoom

A standalone Windows clipboard manager inspired by the current Maccy feature set.

## Goal

Create a Windows clipboard manager that matches the current Maccy feature set as closely as possible, with Windows-native behavior where the platforms differ.

## Current Status

The current build is already usable on Windows and includes:

- clipboard monitoring and history persistence
- text, HTML, RTF, image, and file list capture
- search with exact, fuzzy, regexp, and mixed modes
- search result highlight
- tray icon, tray menu, and global hotkey popup
- preview pane
- pinning, pin rename, and pinned text editing
- auto paste and plain text paste options
- ignore rules, startup registration, history limit, and sorting
- single-instance startup behavior

Still missing or incomplete:

- image preview zoom
- double-tap modifier activation
- OCR, updater, scripting interface, and richer diagnostics

## How To Use

1. Launch `ClipLoom.exe`.
2. Look for the app in the Windows notification area tray.
3. Open clipboard history with the configured global hotkey. The default is `Ctrl+Shift+C`.
4. If that hotkey is busy, click the tray icon instead.
5. Copy text, images, files, or rich text as usual with `Ctrl+C`.
6. Open the popup and search or browse your saved history.
7. Press `Enter` on the selected item to restore it to the clipboard.

By default, selecting an item also auto-pastes it back into the previous window.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- configured global hotkey: open the history popup
- `Up` / `Down`: move through the list
- `Enter`: activate the selected item
- `Esc`: close the popup
- `Delete`: remove the selected history item
- `Ctrl+P`: pin or unpin the selected item
- `Ctrl+R`: rename a pinned item
- `Ctrl+E`: edit pinned plain text
- `Ctrl+1` to `Ctrl+9`: jump to the first 9 visible items

## Settings

Settings are available from both a dedicated tabbed settings window and the tray menu.

To open settings:

1. Right-click the tray icon.
2. Click `Settings...`.

You can still use the grouped tray menu sections for quick toggles.

## Data Storage

The app stores its data under the current user's local app data directory in a `ClipLoom` folder.

For migration compatibility, if an existing `MaccyWindows` data folder is present and `ClipLoom` is not yet created, it will continue using the legacy folder.

It persists:

- history items
- pin state and pinned edits
- popup size and last position
- search mode and sort mode
- capture and ignore settings
- startup preference

## Chosen Stack

The current implementation uses:

- `C++20 + Win32 API + CMake`

The original planning notes mentioned SQLite, but the current build uses a lightweight custom persistence format instead.

## Layout

- `docs/`: planning and design notes
- `src/`: application source code
- `tests/`: unit tests

## Docs

- `docs/windows-maccy-clone-todolist.md`

- `docs/ui-upgrade-options.md`
- `docs/win32-app-split-todolist.md`
- `docs/github-actions-windows-build-notes.md`

## CI

GitHub Actions workflows:

- `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-windows.yml`

They build on `windows-2022`, run tests, package the app, and publish release zip artifacts for tagged versions.
